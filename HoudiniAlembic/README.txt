This is the source to the Alembic SOP and sundry files that was used in this
version of Houdini.  Side Effects endeavours to contribute any changes they
make to the Alembic baseline (http://code.google.com/p/alembic/).  However, it
can take time for changes to filter through to the repo.

This archive is the most up-to-date source available for Houdini.
