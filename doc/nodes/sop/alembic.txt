"""Loads the geometry from an Alembic scene archive (`.abc`) file into a 
geometry network."""

@parameters

File name:
    #id: fileName
    
    Path the Alembic archive (`.abc`) file.

Frame:
    #id: frame
    
    The _Alembic_ frame at which to sample the geometry. The default value is
    `$F` (Houdini's current frame). If you need to offset the start time of the
    animation in the archive, you can add or subtract frames (e.g. `$F + 48`).

Frames per second:
    #id: fps
    
    Combined with the __Frame__ parameter, this is used to convert alembic's
    time-based animation to Houdini frames. The default is `$FPS` (Houdini's
    current frames-per-second setting). If the archive file was created with a
    different FPS, you will need to enter it here.

Object path:
    #id: objectPath
    
    A path to an object inside the archive -- if specified, the node will load
    only this object and its children. The default is blank, which means load
    all the geometry in the archive.

Include Xform:
    #id: includeXform
    
    Bake each object's world space transformation (relative to the root of the
    archive) into the object's points.

Remap attributes:
    #id: remapAttributes
    
    Use this multiparm to rename Alembic point, vertex, and/or primitive
    attributes to their Houdini equivalents. For example, remapping `MyColor`
    to `Cd` (diffuse color). Click the + button to add a new mapping.

Alembic name #:
    #id: abcName
    
    The name of the Alembic attribute to map from.
    
Houdini name:
    #id: hName
    
    The name of the Houdini attribute to map to.
